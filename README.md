**TOPIC: Sales Data**
# Introduction: Overview of Linear Regression.
# I. Explanation of the Topic
You are working with a dataset that includes details of sales transactions. This dataset can be analyzed using Linear Regression techniques to uncover patterns in sales and predict future outcomes. This dataset is ideal for performing regression analysis, time-series analysis, and customer behavior analysis. The goal could be to predict sales based on variables like QUANTITYORDERED, PRICEEACH, DEALSIZE, and ORDERDATE. The SALES column is the target variable for predicting sales outcomes based on other factors.

# Key characteristics and variables of the dataset include:
- **ORDERNUMBER**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **QUANTITYORDERED**: Number of units ordered.
- **PRICEEACH**: Price per unit.
- **SALES**: Total sales amount (dependent variable for potential analysis).
- **ORDERDATE**: Date when the order was placed.
- **STATUS**: Shipping status of the order.
- **QTR_ID, MONTH_ID, YEAR_ID**: Identifiers for the quarter, month, and year of the order.
- **COUNTRY**: Country where the order was shipped.
- **DEALSIZE**: Size of the deal (Small, Medium, Large).

- ### Chosen Dependent Variables
- **SALES** is an ideal dependent variable for Linear Regression as we aim to understand what factors drive the total sales amount.
- The **QUANTITYORDERED**, **PRICEEACH**, and **DEALSIZE** can be considered strong predictors of the total sales.
