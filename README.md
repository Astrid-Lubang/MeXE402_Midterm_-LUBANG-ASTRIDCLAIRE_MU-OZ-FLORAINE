TOPIC: Sales Data
## Introduction: Overview of Linear Regression.
## Explanation of the Topic
You are working with a dataset that includes details of sales transactions. This dataset can be analyzed using Linear Regression techniques to uncover patterns in sales and predict future outcomes.

## Key characteristics and variables of the dataset include:
- **ORDERNUMBER**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **QUANTITYORDERED**: Number of units ordered.
- **PRICEEACH**: Price per unit.
- **SALES**: Total sales amount (dependent variable for potential analysis).
- **ORDERDATE**: Date when the order was placed.
- **STATUS**: Shipping status of the order.
- **QTR_ID, MONTH_ID, YEAR_ID**: Identifiers for the quarter, month, and year of the order.
- **COUNTRY**: Country where the order was shipped.
- **DEALSIZE**: Size of the deal (Small, Medium, Large).

- ### Chosen Dependent Variables
- **SALES** is an ideal dependent variable for Linear Regression as we aim to understand what factors drive the total sales amount.
- The **QUANTITYORDERED**, **PRICEEACH**, and **DEALSIZE** can be considered strong predictors of the total sales.
